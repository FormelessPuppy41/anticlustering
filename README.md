Thesis Anticlustering



NEXT UP:
- Implement the solvers. 
    Start with ILP, then exchange, then add preclustering. (Check feasability via small instances)
    After Table1 has been completed, start implementing a online anticlustering algorithm. 




Online anticluster:

initial clusters are based on id's which depart before ever having arrived -> they were already present.
